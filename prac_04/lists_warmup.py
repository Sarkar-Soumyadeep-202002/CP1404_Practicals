Write Python expressions (in the same Python file) to achieve the following:

1)Change the first element of numbers to "ten" (the string, not the number 10)
2)Change the last element of numbers to 1
3)Get all the elements from numbers except the first two (slice)
4)Check if 9 is an element of numbers
